A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime is commonly used to build fast and scalable network applications. Node. js employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model making it efficient, and perfect for data-intensive real-time applications operating across distributed devices.

This competency area includes building and managing web applications with a focus on creating Express.js servers, implementing routing, utilizing middleware, designing RESTful APIs, and handling errors effectively.

Key Competencies:

Create a Server using Express.JS: Explore how to set up a web server using Express.js, a fast and minimal web framework for Node.js, to efficiently handle HTTP requests and responses.
Routing: Gain familiarity with defining routes to handle specific HTTP methods and paths, enabling structured navigation and functionality in web applications

Middleware: Understanding how to use middleware functions to handle requests, responses, and application logic, including built-in, third-party, and custom middleware.

Error Handling: Understanding how to manage errors in a Node.js application by implementing structured error-handling mechanisms. This includes using try-catch blocks, centralized error-handling functions, and proper logging. 

RESTful API Design: Building and structuring a REST API with proper routes and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
